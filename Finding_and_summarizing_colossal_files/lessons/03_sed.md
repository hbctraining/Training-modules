# sed

The ***s***tream ***ed***itor, `sed`, is a common tool used for text manipulation. `sed` takes input from either a file or piped from a previous command and applies a transformation to it before outputting it to standard output.

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, we will:

- Substitute characters using `sed`
- Utilize addresses in our `sed` commands
- Delete lines from output using `sed`

## Quick Note on Quotation Marks

Many of the same arguments that were made for using single vs. double quotation marks in `grep` also apply to `sed`. However, the `$` has some non-variable functionality in `sed` that we will discuss, particularly with reference to addresses. For this reason, it's more common to see `sed` commands wrapped in single-quotes rather than double-quotes. Of course, if you want to use a `bash` variable in `sed` you are going to need to wrap it in double-quotes, but if you do then you need be cautious of any non-variable usage of `$` and be sure to escape it (`\`).

## substitution

Before we get started let's take a brief look at the main dataset that will be using for this lesson, the `ecosystems.txt` file:

```
less ecosystems.txt
```

One common usage for `sed` is to replace `pattern` with `replacement`. The syntax for doing this is:

```
# DON'T RUN
sed 's/pattern/replacement/flag' file.txt 
```

A few things to note here:

1) The `s` in `'s/pattern/replacement/flag'` is directing `sed` to do a ***s***ubstitution.

2) The `flag` in `'s/pattern/replacement/flag'` is directing `sed` that you want this action to be carried out in a specific manner. It is very common to use the flag `g` here which will carry out the action ***g***lobally, or each time it matches the `pattern` in a line. If `g`, is not included it wil just replace the `pattern` the first time it is observed per line. If you would like to replace a particular occurance like the third time it is observed in a line, then you would use `3`.

Let's test this out on our `ecosystems.txt` sample file and see that output. First, we are interested in replacing `jungle` with `rainforest` throughout the file:

```
sed 's/jungle/rainforest/g' ecosystems.txt
```

Notice how all instances of `jungle` have been replaced with `rainforest`. However, if we don't include the global option:

```
sed 's/jungle/rainforest/' ecosystems.txt
```

We will only recover the first instance of `jungle` was replaced with `rainforest`. If we want to replace only the second occurance of `jungle` with `rainforest` on a line, modify the occurance flag to be `2`:

```
sed 's/jungle/rainforest/2' ecosystems.txt
```

**It is important to note that the pattern-matching in `sed` is case-sensitive.** To make your pattern searches case-insensitive, you will need to add at the `I` flag:

```
sed 's/jungle/rainforest/Ig' ecosystems.txt
```

This will now replace all instances of `Jungle`/`jungle`/`JuNgLe`/`jUngle`/etc. with `rainforest`.

You can also replace all instances of a match starting at *n*-th match and continuing for the rest of the line. For instance if we want the second match and all subsequent matches  of `jungle` to be replaced with `rainforest`, then we could use:

```
sed 's/jungle/rainforest/2g' ecosystems.txt
```

> NOTE: Depending on your implementation of `sed`, this command may give the error that too many flags have been provided.

### -n option

In `sed` the `-n` option will create no standard output. However, you can pair it with the flag `p` and this will print out only lines that were were edited. For example:

```
sed -n 's/desert/Sahara/pg' ecosystems.txt
```

The `-n` option has another useful purpose, you can use it to find the line number of a matched pattern by using `=` after the pattern you are searching for:

```
sed -n '/jungle/ =' ecosystems.txt
```

## Addresses

### Single lines

One can also direct which line, the ***address***, `sed` should make an edit on by adding the line number in front of `s`. This is most common when one wants to make a substituion for a pattern in a header line and we are concerned that the pattern might be elsewhere in the file. For example, we can compare the following commands:

```
sed 's/an/replacement/g' ecosystems.txt
sed '1 s/an/replacement/g' ecosystems.txt
```

* In the **first command**, `sed 's/an/replacement/g' animals.txt` we have replaced all instances of `an` with `replacement`. 
    * `animal` changed to `replacementimal`
    * `toucan` also changed to `toucreplacement`
    * `anaconda` changed to `replacementaconda`
* In the **second command**, `sed '1 s/an/replacement/g' ecosystems.txt`, we have only replaced instances on line 1.

If you only want to replace an occurence in the final line of a file you can use `$` like:

```
sed '$ s/jag/replacement/g' ecosystems.txt
```

### Intervals

If we only want to have this substitution carried out on the first five lines, then we would need to do include this interval (`1,5`, this is giving an address interval, from line 1 to line 5):

```
sed '1,5 s/an/replacement/g' ecosystems.txt
```

You can also replace the second address with a `$` to indicate until end of the file like:

```
sed '5,$ s/an/replacement/g' ecosystems.txt
```

This will carry out the substitution from the fifth line until the end of the file.

You can also use regular expressions in the address field. For example, if you only wanted the substitution happening between your first occurence of `camel` and your first occurrance of `cichlid`, you could do:

```
sed '/camel/,/cichlid/ s/an/replacement/g' ecosystems.txt
```

Additionally, if you want a replacement every occurance except a given line, such as all of you data fields but not on the header line, then one could use `!` which tells sed "not", like:

```
sed '1! s/an/replacement/g' ecosystems.txt
```

You can even couple `!` with the regular expression intervals to do the substitution everywhere outside the interval:

```
sed '/camel/,/cichlid/! s/an/replacement/g' ecosystems.txt
```

Lastly, you can use `N~n` in the address to indicate that you want to apply the substitution every *n*-th line starting on line *N*. In the below example, starting on the first line and every 2nd line, the substitution will occur

```
sed '1~2 s/an/replacement/g' ecosystems.txt
```

## Deletion

You can delete entire lines in `sed`. To delete lines we will need to provide the address followed by `d`. To delete the first line from a file:

```
sed '1d' ecosystems.txt
```

Like substitutions, you can provide an interval and this will delete line 1 to line 3:

```
sed '1,3d' ecosystems.txt
```

Also like substitution, you can use `!` to specify lines not to delete like:

```
sed '1,3!d' ecosystems.txt
```

Additionally, you can also use regular expressions to provide the addresses to define an interval to delete from. In this case we are interested in deleting from the first instance of `cichlid` until the end of the file:

```
sed '/cichlid/,$d' ecosystems.txt
```

The `N~n` syntax also works in deletion. If we want to delete every third line starting on line 2, we can do:

```
sed '2~3d' ecosystems.txt
```

## Appending

### Appending, Inserting and Changing Text

You can append a new line with the word `starfish` after the 2nd line using the `a` command in `sed`:

```
sed '2 a starfish' ecosystems.txt
```

You can also append over an interval, like from the 2nd to 4th line:

```
sed '2,4 a starfish' ecosystems.txt
```

Additionally, you can append the text every 3rd line begining with the second line:

```
sed '2~3 a starfish' ecosystems.txt
```

You can also append after a matched pattern:

```
sed '/monkey/ a starfish' ecosystems.txt
```

If you want the ***i***nsert text to come before the address, you need to use the `i` command:

```
sed '2 i starfish' ecosystems.txt
```

### Appending a file

We could be interested in inserting the contents of **file B** inside at a certain point of **file A**. Before we append a file, let's briefly inspect the file we will try to append:

```
less more_ecosystems.txt
```

For example, if you wanted to insert the contents `more_ecosystems.txt` after line `4` in `ecosystems.txt`, you could do:

```
sed '4 r more_ecosystems.txt' ecosystems.txt
```

The `r` argument is telling `sed` to ***r***ead in `more_ecosystems.txt`.

Instead of line `4`, you can append the file between every line in the interval from line 2 to line 4 with:

```
sed '2,4 r more_ecosystems.txt' ecosystems.txt
```

You could also append the line after each line by using `1~1` syntax:

```
sed '1~1 r more_ecosystems.txt' ecosystems.txt
```

Instead of inserting on a line specific line, you can also insert on a pattern:

```
sed '/camel/ r more_ecosystems.txt' ecosystems.txt
```

Lastly, you could also insert a file to the end using `$`:

```
sed '$ r more_ecosystems.txt' ecosystems.txt
```

But this is the same result as simply concatenating two files together like:

```
cat ecosystems.txt more_ecosystems.txt
```

### Changing Lines

You can also ***c***hange entire lines in `sed` using the `c` command. We could replace the first line with the word 'header' by:

```
sed '1 c header' ecosystems.txt
```

This can also be utilized in conjunction with the `A,B` interval syntax, but we should be aware that it will replace ALL lines in that interval with a SINGLE line.

```
sed '1,3 c header' ecosystems.txt
```

You can also replace every *n*-th line starting at *N*-th line using the `N~n` address syntax:

```
sed '1~3 c header' ecosystems.txt
```

Lastly, you can also replace lines match a pattern:

```
sed '/jaguar/ c header' ecosystems.txt
```

## Transform

`sed` has a feature that allows you to transform characters similiarly to the `tr` function in `bash`. If you wanted to transform all of the lowercase a, b and c characters to their uppercase equivalents you could do that with the `y` command:

```
sed 'y/abc/ABC/' ecosystems.txt
```

In this case the first letter 'a' is replaced with 'A', 'b' with 'B' and 'c' with 'C'.

## Multiple expressions

### `-e` option

If you would like to carry out multiple `sed` expressions in the same command you can use the `-e` option and after each `-e` option you can provide the expression you would like `sed` to evaluate. For example, one could change `jungle` to `rainforest` and `lake` to `freshwater`:

```
sed -e 's/jungle/rainforest/g' -e 's/lake/freshwater/g' ecosystems.txt
```

One can also combine different type of expressions. For instance, one could change `jungle` to `rainforest` using a substitution expression and then use a deletion expression to remove the header line:

```
sed -e 's/jungle/rainforest/g' -e '1d' ecosystems.txt
```

If you want to use different flags to mark the occurence of a substitution, you will need to use the `-e` option:

```
sed -e 's/jungle/rainforest/3' -e 's/jungle/rainforest/1' ecosystems.txt
```

> **NOTE:** The occurences flag needs to go in decreasing order from the end of the line to the beginning of the line. Notice how `-e 's/jungle/rainforest/3'` comes before `-e 's/jungle/rainforest/1'`.

### `-f` option

If you have a large number of `sed` expressions you can also place them in a text file, like the `sed_expressions.txt` file, where each expression is on a separate line:

```
s/jungle/rainforest/g
s/lake/freshwater/g
1d
```

Then we can use the `-f` option to provide this file of `sed` expressions by using:

```
sed -f sed_expressions.txt ecosystems.txt
```

## Exercise

Within your directory, there is a FASTQ file called, `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq`. We would like to create a file of `sed` commands to convert this FASTQ file into a FASTA file. In order to do this, we need to briefly outline the difference between a FASTQ and FASTA file.

**FASTQ files**

There are four lines in a FASTQ file per entry that correspond to:

- Line 1: The header line that starts with `@`
- Line 2: The sequence line
- Line 3: Usually just holds a `+`
- Line 4: Base scores corresponding to the bases in Line 2

**FASTA files**

There are only two lines in a FASTA file per entry that correspond to:

- Line 1: The header line that starts with `>`
- Line 2: The sequence line

Let's do this task in a few parts:

**1)** Create a new file in `vim` called `fastq_to_fasta.txt` to put our `sed` commands within 

**2)** Make the first `sed` command within this file be the one that implements a `>` at the *start* of the first line of each entry. *Hint: A regex tool could be helpful for this task*

**3)** Make the next two `sed` commands within this file delete the third and fourth lines of each entry

**4)** Run this file of `sed` commands on our FASTQ file and redirect the output to a new file called `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fa`
