## Tips and Tricks on O2

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | [Beginner bash](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Basic_shell/) | 2-3 hour workshop (~2-3 hours of trainer-led time) |


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **3 hour**, hands-on **Intermediate bash** workshop led at a relaxed pace. Many tools for the analysis of big data require the use of a high performance compute cluster and a knowledge of the command line. In this workshop we invite users of the HMS Research Computing Cluster O2 and members of the Harvard community who are interested in using a compute cluster to join us as we demonstrate some very helpful tips and best practices. We will introduce participants to various commands and approaches to help effectively navigate use the cluster and complete tasks in an efficient manner. 

_This workshop is being held in collaboration with HMS Research Computing, and is an advanced workshop requiring knowledge of the command-line and/or the basic shell skills learned in The Foundation - Basic Shell._

### Learning Objectives

  

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.
