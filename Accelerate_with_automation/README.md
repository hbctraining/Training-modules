## Accelerate with Automation - Making your code work for you

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | [Beginner bash](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Intro_shell/) | 2-3 hour workshop (~2-3 hours of trainer-led time) |


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **3 hour**, hands-on **Intermediate bash** workshop led at a relaxed pace. Many tools for the analysis of big data require knowledge of the command line, and this workshop will build on the basic skills taught in the **The Foundation - Basic Shell** workshop to allow for greater automation using scripts. 

### Learning Objectives

* Define what a variable is and store information using variables
* Distinguish between variables and positional parameters
* Create a script to run multiple commands as a single command
* Implement loops, positional parameters and variables in a bash script
* Learn about slurm arrays for automation on a high performance computing cluster

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.
