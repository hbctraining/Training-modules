| Biologists | [Beginner bash](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Intro_shell/) | 2-3 hour workshop (~2-3 hours of trainer-led time) |


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **2 hour**, hands-on **Intermediate bash** workshop led at a relaxed pace. Many tools for the analysis of big data require knowledge of the command line, and this workshop will build on the basic skills taught in the **Introduction to the command-line interface** workshop to allow for greater automation. This workshop will include lessons on using the command-line text editor, Vim, to create and edit files, utilizing for-loops for automation, using variables to store information, and writing scripts to perform a series of commands in a sequential order. 

### Learning Objectives

* Learning basic operations using the Vim text editor
* Capturing previous commands into a script to re-run with one single command
* Understanding variables and storing information
* Learning how to use variables to operate on multiple files

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
