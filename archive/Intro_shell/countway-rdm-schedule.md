## Introduction to the Command Line Interface

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | None | 1.5 hour workshop |


### Description

Many data analysis tools and computational resources require users to have a basic working knowledge of the command line interface (also referred to as UNIX, Linux, bash, shell). In this workshop participants will learn basic commands for performing simple tasks within a filesystem without the use of a point and click environment.

> This class is part of the Countway Library [Research Data Management Seminar Series](https://libcal.countway.harvard.edu/calendar/countway/command-line).

### Learning Objectives

*  **Accessing the bash shell:** Understanding how to start up the command-line interface
*  **Navigating the file directory:** Recognizing the organization of the file directory and exploring the folders/files
*  **Performing file operations:** Understanding ways to manipulate files, such as creating, moving, copying, and renaming files
*  **Exploring file contents:** Learning how to look at the contents of files
*  **Searching files:** Practicing searching for patterns within files

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
