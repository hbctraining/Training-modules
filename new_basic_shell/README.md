| Biologists | None | 2-3 hour workshop (~3 hours of trainer-led time)|


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **2-3 hour**, hands-on **Introduction to the command-line interface** workshop led at a relaxed pace. 


### Learning Objectives

* Recognize the importance of bash in the analysis of high throughput sequencing (HTS) data
* Install and locate the software/tools necessary for accessing the command line
*  Describe the organization of the file directory and how to move through it
*  Demonstrate different ways to manipulate files, such as moving, copying, and renaming
*  Compare different commands for examining small or large files
*  Create existing files with nano, and make edits to existing files
*  Contrast shell scripts with direct commands


> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
