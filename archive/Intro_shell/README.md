:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | None | 2-hour workshop (~2 hours of trainer-led time)|


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **2 hour**, hands-on **Introduction to the command-line interface** workshop led at a relaxed pace. 

Many data analysis tools and computational resources require users to have a basic working knowledge of the command line interface (also referred to as *UNIX, Linux, bash, shell*). In this workshop participants will learn basic commands for navigating the file system, exploring file contents, and performing basic operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming files/folders. 

### Learning Objectives

*  **Accessing the bash shell:** Understanding how to start up the command-line interface
*  **Navigating the file directory:** Recognizing the organization of the file directory and exploring the folders/files
*  **Performing file operations:** Understanding ways to manipulate files, such as moving, copying, and renaming files
*  **Exploring file contents:** Learning how to look at the contents of files
*  **Finding help:** Utilizing resources to determine how to specify desired commands
*  **Searching files:** Practicing searching for patterns within files
*  **Redirecting output:** Using redirection operators to create new files, append contents to an already existing file, and combining commands together

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
