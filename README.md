This repository has teaching materials for **2-3 hour**, hands-on workshops covering a variety of topics related to bioinformatics data analysis. The workshops will lead participants through performing different types of analyses using R/RStudio or Linux. 

Some workshops will require a working knowledge of R or completion of the [Introduction to R workshop](IntroR). Other workshops will require a working knowledge of the bash scripting language or completion of the [Introduction to Shell workshop](Intro_shell/). 

** **NOTE: Detailed information** and **preparation instructions** for each of the workshops can be found by clicking on the workshop links in the table below.
