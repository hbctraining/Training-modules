# Introduction to Python

## Description
Python is a powerful open source programming language for many applications in bioinformatics. In this 3 hour, hands-on workshop, we will teach basic concepts in Python programming. These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop aimed at beginners, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

## Objectives
This workshop covers the fundamentals of Python, with the following learning objectives:
- Implement basic syntax
- Create and manipulate lists
- Use built-in functions, and create user-defined functions
- Apply conditional statements

By the end of this workshop, students should be able to create Python scripts and perform some simple programming tasks. 

## Requirements
To complete this workshop, you will need **a computer** and **a Google account** (to access Colab). **There is no need to install Python or any other tool.**

## Who should take this beginner workshop?
You will find this workshop helpful, if you:
- Have none or very little background in programming, and would like to start learning a general programming language
- Have experience in other programming languages (e.g. R), but would like to learn and apply Python in your work
- Have sparse experience with using Python, but would like to brush up on fundamental concepts

> Note: while this course is developed with teaching life science researchers in mind, it can be used for/by students with any technical background.

> Note: we might be developing advanced topics of Python based on general interest, so stay tuned!
