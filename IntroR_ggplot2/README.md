## Introduction to R with ggplot2

### Description
This repository has teaching materials for a **2-3 hour**, hands-on **Introduction to R** workshop led at a quick pace. The workshop will give participants an overview of the basics of R and RStudio. R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R. 

These materials are intended to provide a **quick overview** of the R programming language and plotting with the ggplot2 package. 

### Learning Objectives

* **R syntax**: Understanding the different 'parts of speech' in R; introducing variables and functions, demonstrating how functions work, and modifying arguments for specific use cases.
* **Data structures in R**: Getting a handle on the classes of data structures and the types of data used by R.
* **Data inspection and wrangling**: Reading in data from files. Using indices and various functions to subset, merge, and create datasets.
* **Visualizing data**: Visualizing data using plotting functions from the ggplot2 package.
* **Exporting data and graphics**: Generating new data tables and plots for use outside of the R environment.

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
