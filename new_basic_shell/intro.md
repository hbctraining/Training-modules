## Introduction to the Command Line Interface

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | None | 3-hour workshop (~3 hours of trainer-led time)|


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **3 hour**, hands-on **Introduction to the command-line interface** workshop led at a relaxed pace. 

Many data analysis tools and computational resources require users to have a basic working knowledge of the command line interface (also referred to as *UNIX, Linux, bash, shell*). In this workshop participants will learn basic commands for navigating the file system, exploring file contents, and performing basic operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming files/folders. 

### Learning Objectives

*  **Recognize the importance of bash in the analysis of high throughput sequencing (HTS) data**
*  **Install and locate the programs necessary for accessing the command line** 
*  **Describe the organization of the file directory and how to move through it**
*  **Demonstrate different ways to manipulate files, such as moving, copying, and renaming**
*  **Write and edit new or existing files with nano**
*  **Select the proper command for examining small or large files**
*  **Contrast shell scripts with direct commands and explain the different parts of a shell script** 

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
