## Learning Objectives
- How do you access the shell?


## Starting with the shell

**With Macs**

Macs have a utility application called "**Terminal**" for performing tasks on the command line (shell). We can open this utility to access the shell. This is generally found in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal`

**With Windows**

By default, there is no terminal for the bash shell available in the Windows OS, so you have to use a downloaded program. We recommend "**Git BASH**" a shell (bash) emulator that is a part of the [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) download.

#### Command prompt

Once you have opened the shell, you should see the command prompt ending with `$`. It will have some characters before the `$`, something like `[MacBook-Pro-5:~]`, this is telling you what the name of the computer you are working on is. 

```bash
[MacBook-Pro-5:~]$ 
```


### Downloading data

We will be exploring the capabilities of the shell by working with some RNA-Seq data. We need to **download the data to our current folder** using the link below. To do so, follow the step-by-step instructions below.

**1. Find out what folder we are currently inside**. To do this, we can use the 'print working directory' command:

```bash
$ pwd
```

> On a **Mac** your current folder should be something starting with `/Users/`, like `/Users/marypiper/`.
> 
> On a **Windows** machine your current folder should be something starting with `C:/Users/marypiper`. To find this in your File explorer try clicking on PC and navigating to that path.

_Once you have identified which folder you are in, this is where we will be downloading your data._

**2. Right click on the link below, and be sure to "Save link as..."**. You will be prompted to choose a folder within a Finder/File Explorer window. Navigate to the directory that was listed when running `pwd`.

* Download data by [right-clicking here](https://github.com/hbctraining/Training-modules/blob/master/Intro_shell/data/unix_lesson.zip?raw=true) and choose **Save link as**.

**3.** Once you have downloaded the file to the correct location, go back to your **terminal window and type the 'list' command**:

```bash
$ ls
```

> `ls` stands for 'list' and it lists the contents of a directory.

_You should see `unix_lesson.zip` as part of the output to the screen._

**4.** Finally, to **decompress the folder**, we can use the `unzip` command:

```bash
$ unzip unix_lesson.zip 
```

_You should see output stating the contents of the folder are being decompressed or inflated; this is good._ 

**5.** Now when you **run the `ls` command** again you should see a folder called `unix_lesson`.

```bash
$ ls
```
