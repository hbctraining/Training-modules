# Learnign Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Describe Shiny app hosting options
- How to upload and app to a hosting service

# App Hosting

When one develops an app, they are commonly placed on a server that makes the app accessible to a broader audience. These servers are connected to the internet and thus allow users to utilize your app globally any time of day. However, there are computaitonal needs to hosting these apps and costs associated with running the servers behind these apps. We will briefly discuss a few options that app developers have for distributing their apps. 

## Local usage

One option for distributing your as is distributing to be run on people own computers (locally). If your app is small-scale, this might be a reasonable solution in order to excepe fees that are associated with running a server to host your app. This can be done for free. However, one issue with this approach is that it is sensitive to version issues. If a develops their app with a certain version of tidyverse and the user is using a different version, there could be verion incapabilities. For this reason alone, sharing aps to be run locally is not always considered a great practice.

## HMS Research Data Visualization Platform (RDVP)

The next option for hosting your Shiny apps is availible to **HMS Quad-based faculty, staff, and students**. Ufortunately, HSDM, HSPH, hospital affiliates, and hospital-based labs are _not_ eligible. Currently, the HMS-Research Data Visualization Platform is running a pilot program for Posit (RStudio) Connect. Users who use this option have access to an unlimited number of apps and computation hours for the duration of the pilot at no cost.
