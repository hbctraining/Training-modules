## Tips and Tricks for the O2 cluster

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | [Foundations in Shell](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Basic_shell/) | 2-3 hour workshop (~2-3 hours of trainer-led time) |


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **3 hour**, hands-on **Intermediate bash** workshop led at a relaxed pace. Many tools for the analysis of big data require the use of a high performance compute cluster and a knowledge of the command line. In this workshop we invite users of the **HMS Research Computing Cluster O2** and members of the Harvard community who are interested in using a compute cluster to join us as we demonstrate some very **helpful tips and best practices**. We will introduce participants to various commands and approaches to help effectively navigate use the cluster and complete tasks in an efficient manner. 

_This workshop is being held in collaboration with HMS Research Computing, and is an advanced workshop requiring knowledge of the command-line and/or the basic shell skills learned in the Foundations of Shell._

### Learning Objectives

In this workshop, we will:

- Establish a `scratch` space on the O2 computing cluster and check our storage quotas
- Modify our `.bashrc` profile with commonly used aliases
- Download external data to O2 from a website
- Locally download and upload data to and from O2
- Manage job submissions to O2 

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.
