### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **3 hour**, hands-on **Intermediate bash** workshop led at a relaxed pace. Many tools for the analysis of big data require knowledge of the command line, and this workshop will build on the basic skills taught in the **The Foundation - Basic Shell** workshop to teach users basic command line functions such as `grep`, `sed` and `awk` to find and summarize information from large files. 

### Learning Objectives

* Recognize basic regex
* Utilize regex to cast a wider next with `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`
* Differentiate between best use cases for `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`
* Implement proper syntax for `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` commands
* Observe the wide range of options for `sed` to perform various tasks
* Identify bioinformatic applications for `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.
