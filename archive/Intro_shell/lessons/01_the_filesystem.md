## Learning Objectives
- How do you access the shell?
- How do you use it?
  - Getting around the Unix file system
  - looking at files
  - manipulating files
  - automating tasks
- What is it good for?

## Starting with the shell

**With Macs**

Macs have a utility application called "**Terminal**" for performing tasks on the command line (shell). We can open this utility to access the shell.

**With Windows**

By default, there is no terminal for the bash shell available in the Windows OS, so you have to use a downloaded program, "**Git BASH**". Git BASH is part of the [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) download, and is a shell (bash) emulator.

#### Command prompt

Once you have opened the shell, you should see the command prompt ending with `$`. It will have some characters before the `$`, something like `[MacBook-Pro-5:~]`, this is telling you what the name of the computer you are working on is. 

```bash
[MacBook-Pro-5:~]$ 
```


### Downloading data

We will be exploring the capabilities of the shell by working with some RNA-Seq data. We need to **download the data to our current folder** using the link below. To do so, follow the step-by-step instructions below.

**1. Find out what folder we are currently inside**. To do this, we can use the 'print working directory' command:

```bash
$ pwd
```

> On a **Mac** your current folder should be something starting with `/Users/`, like `/Users/marypiper/`.
> 
> On a **Windows** machine your current folder should be something starting with `C:/Users/marypiper`. To find this in your File explorer try clicking on PC and navigating to that path.

_Once you have identified which folder you are in, this is where we will be downloading your data._

**2. Right click on the link below, and be sure to "Save link as..."**. You will be prompted to choose a folder within a Finder/File Explorer window. Navigate to the directory that was listed when running `pwd`.

* Download data by [right-clicking here](https://github.com/hbctraining/Training-modules/blob/master/Intro_shell/data/unix_lesson.zip?raw=true) and choose **Save link as**.

**3.** Once you have downloaded the file to the correct location, go back to your **terminal window and type the 'list' command**:

```bash
$ ls
```
_You should see `unix_lesson.zip` as part of the output to the screen._

**4.** Finally, to **decompress the folder**, we can use the `unzip` command:

```bash
$ unzip unix_lesson.zip 
```

_You should see output stating the contents of the folder are being decompressed or inflated; this is good._ 

**5.** Now when you **run the `ls` command** again you should see a folder called `unix_lesson`.

```bash
$ ls
```

### Exploring the data directory

Now we have each created our own copy of the example data folder into our home directory, **`unix_lesson`**. Let's go into the data folder and explore the data using the shell.

```bash
$ cd unix_lesson
```

> 'cd' stands for 'change directory'

Let's see what is in here. Type:

```bash
$ ls
```

You will see:

```
genomics_data  other  raw_fastq  README.txt  reference_data
```
> `ls` stands for 'list' and it lists the contents of a directory.

There are five items listed. What types of files are they? We can use a "modifier" with `ls` to get more information; this modifier is called an argument (more below).

```bash
$ ls -F

genomics_data/  other/  raw_fastq/  README.txt  reference_data/
```

Anything with a forward slash `/` after it is a directory. Things with an asterik `*` after them are programs.  If there are no decorations after the name, it's a file.

> All commands are essentially programs that are able to perform specific, commonly-used tasks.

You can also use the command:

```bash
$ ls -l
```

to see whether items in a directory are files or directories. `ls -l` gives a lot more information too.
```
total 124
drwxrwsr-x 2 mp298 mp298  78 Sep 30 10:47 genomics_data
drwxrwsr-x 6 mp298 mp298 107 Sep 30 10:47 other
drwxrwsr-x 2 mp298 mp298 228 Sep 30 10:47 raw_fastq
-rw-rw-r-- 1 mp298 mp298 377 Sep 30 10:47 README.txt
drwxrwsr-x 2 mp298 mp298 238 Sep 30 10:47 reference_data
```

Let's go into the `raw_fastq` directory and see what is in there.

```bash
$ cd raw_fastq/

$ ls -F

Irrel_kd_1.subset.fq  Irrel_kd_3.subset.fq  Mov10_oe_2.subset.fq
Irrel_kd_2.subset.fq  Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq  Mov10_oe_3.subset.fq
```

All six items in this directory have no trailing slashes, so they are all files, not folders or programs.


#### Arguments

Most commands take additional arguments that control their exact behavior. For example, `-F` and `-l` are arguments to `ls`.  The `ls` command, like many commands, take a lot of arguments. Another useful one is `-a`, which shows everything, including hidden files.  How do we know what the available arguments that go with a particular command are?

Most commonly used shell commands have a manual available in the shell. You can access the
manual using the `man` command. Try entering:

```bash
$ man ls
```

This will open the manual page for `ls`. Use the 'space' key to go forward and 'b' to go backwards. When you are done reading, just hit `q` to quit.

Commands that are run from the shell can get extremely complicated. To see an example, open up the manual page for the `find` command. No one can possibly learn all of these arguments, of course. So you will probably find yourself referring to the manual page frequently.

> If the manual page within the terminal is hard to read and traverse, the manual exists online, use your web searching powers to get it! In addition to the arguments, you can also find good examples online; Google is your friend.


## The Unix directory file structure (a.k.a. where am I?)
 
As you've already just seen, you can move around in different directories or folders at the command line. Why would you want to do this, rather than just navigating around the normal way using a GUI (GUI = Graphical User Interface, pronounced like "gooey").

#### Moving around the file system

Let's practice moving around a bit.

We're going to work in that `unix_lesson` directory.

First we did something like go to the folder of our username. Then we opened `unix_lesson` then `raw_fastq`

Like on any computer you have used before the file structure within unix is hierarchical, like an upside down tree with root (`/`) as the starting point of the tree-like structure:

![Unix](../img/Slide1.jpg)

That root (`/`) is often also called the 'top' level.

When you log in to a remote computer you are on one of the branches of that tree, your home directory (e.g. /home/username)

> On mac OS, which is a UNIX-based OS, the root level is also "/". On a windows OS, it is drive specific; generally "C:\" is considered root, but it changes to "D:/", if you are on that drive.

Now let's go do that same navigation at the command line.

Type:

```bash
$ cd
```

> This puts you in your home directory. No matter where you are in the directory system, `cd` will always bring you back to your home directory.


Now using `cd` and `ls`, go in to the `unix_lesson` directory and list its contents. Now go into the `raw_fastq` directory, and list its contents.

Let's also check to see where we are. Sometimes when we're wandering around in the file system, it's easy to lose track of where we are. The command that tells you this is:

```bash
$ pwd
```

> This stands for 'print working directory'. i.e. the directory you're currently working in.

What if we want to move back up and out of the `raw_fastq` directory? Can we just type `cd unix_lesson`? Try it and see what happens.

To go 'back up a level' we can use `..`

Type:

```bash
$ cd ..
```

Now do `ls` and `pwd`. 

> `..` denotes parent directory, and you can use it anywhere in the system to go back to the parent directory. Can you think of an example when this won't work?


#### Examining the contents of other directories

By default, the `ls` commands lists the contents of the working directory (i.e. the directory you are in). You can always find the directory you are in using the `pwd` command. However, you can also give `ls` the names of other directories to view. Navigate to the home directory if you are not already there.

Type:

```bash
$ cd
```

Then enter the command:

```bash
$ ls unix_lesson/
```

This will list the contents of the `unix_lesson` directory without you having to navigate there.

The `cd` command works in a similar way.

```bash
$ cd unix_lesson/raw_fastq/
$ pwd
```

You should now be in `raw_fastq` and you got there without having to go through the intermediate directory. 

> If you are aware of the directory structure, you can string together as long a list as you like.


****

**Exercise**

List the `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq` file from your home directory without changing directories.

****

## Full vs. Relative Paths

The `cd` command takes an argument which is the directory name. Directories can be specified using either a *relative path* or a *full path*. As we know, the directories on the computer are arranged into a hierarchy. The full path tells you where a directory is in that hierarchy. Navigate to the home directory (`cd`). Now, enter the `pwd` command and you should see something like:

```bash
$ pwd
```

```
/Users/marypiper/
```

which is the full path for your home directory. This tells you that you are in a directory called `marypiper`, which sits inside a directory called `Users` which sits inside the very top directory in the hierarchy, the *root directory*. So, to summarize: `marypiper` is a directory in `Users` which is a directory in `/`.

Now enter the following command:

```bash
$ cd /Users/marypiper/unix_lesson/raw_fastq/
```

This jumps to `raw_fastq`. Now go back to the home directory (`cd`). We saw
earlier that the command:

```bash
$ cd unix_lesson/raw_fastq/
```

had the same effect - it took us to the `raw_fastq` directory. But, instead of specifying the full path (`/Users/marypiper/unix_lesson/raw_fastq`), we specified a *relative path*. In other words, we specified the path **relative to our current working directory**. 

**A full path always starts with a `/`, a relative path does not.**

A relative path is like getting directions from someone on the street. They tell you to "go right at the Stop sign, and then turn left on Main Street". That works great if you're standing there together, but not so well if you're trying to tell someone how to get there from another country. A full path is like GPS coordinates. It tells you exactly where something is no matter where you are right now.

You can usually use either a full path or a relative path depending on what is most convenient. If we are in the home directory, it is more convenient to just enter the relative path since it involves less typing.

Over time, it will become easier for you to keep a mental note of the structure of the directories that you are using and how to quickly navigate among them.

***

**Exercise**

Change directories to `~/unix_lesson/raw_fastq/`, and list the contents of `unix_lesson/other` without changing directories again.

***

### Saving time with tab completion, wildcards and other shortcuts 

#### Tab completion

Navigate to the home directory. Typing out directory names can waste a lot of time. When you start typing out the name of a directory, then hit the tab key, the shell will try to fill in the rest of the directory name. For example, type `cd` to get back to your home directly, then enter:

```bash
$ cd uni<tab>
```

The shell will fill in the rest of the directory name for `unix_lesson`. Now go to `unix_lesson/raw_fastq` and 

```bash
$ ls Mov10_oe_<tab><tab>
```

When you hit the first tab, nothing happens. The reason is that there are multiple directories in the home directory which start with `Mov10_oe_`. Thus, the shell does not know which one to fill in. When you hit tab again, the shell will list the possible choices.

Tab completion can also fill in the names of commands. For example, enter `e<tab><tab>`. You will see the name of every command that starts with an `e`. One of those is `echo`. If you enter `ec<tab>` you will see that tab completion works. 

> **Tab completion is your friend!** It helps prevent spelling mistakes, and speeds up the process of typing in the full command.

#### Wild cards

Navigate to the `raw_fastq` directory, which is inside the `unix_lesson` directory. This directory contains FASTQ files from a next-generation sequencing dataset. 

The '*' character is a shortcut for "zero or more characters". Thus, if you enter `ls *`, you will see all of the contents of a given directory. Now try this command:

```bash
$ ls *fq
```

This lists every file that begins with zero or any number of characters followed by a `fq`. This command:

```bash
$ ls /bin/*sh
```

Lists every file in `/bin` that ends in the characters `sh`.

```bash
$ ls Mov10*fq
```

lists only the files that begin with 'Mov10' and end with 'fq'

So how does this actually work? The shell (bash) considers an asterisk "*" to be a wildcard character that can be used to substitute for: no characters, any other single character or a string of characters. An asterisk/star is only one of the many wildcards in UNIX, but this is the most powerful one and we will be using this one the most for our exercises.

> _**NOTE: The wildcard asterik used in shell is different than how it is used in regular expressions.**_ For example in regular expressions, you have to use the period character followed by the asterik .* to mean "zero or more characters". 

****

**Exercise**

Do each of the following using a single `ls` command without
navigating to a different directory.

1.  List all of the files in `/bin` that start with the letter 'c'
2.  List all of the files in `/bin` that contain the letter 'a'
3.  List all of the files in `/bin` that end with the letter 'o'

BONUS: List all of the files in `/bin` that contain the letter 'a' or 'c'.

****

#### Shortcuts

There are some shortcuts which you should know about. Dealing with the
home directory is very common. So, in the shell the tilde character,
"~", is a shortcut for your home directory. Navigate to the `raw_fastq`
directory:

```bash
$ cd
```

```bash
$ cd unix_lesson/raw_fastq
```

Then enter the command:

```bash
$ ls ~
```

This prints the contents of your home directory, without you having to type the full path because the tilde "~" is equivalent to `/Users/marypiper/`.

Another shortcut is the "..":

```bash
$ ls ..
```

The shortcut `..` always refers to the directory above your current directory. So, it prints the contents of the `unix_lesson`. You can chain these together, so:

```bash
$ ls ../..
```

prints the contents of `/Users/marypiper/` which is your home directory. 

Finally, the special directory `.` always refers to your current directory. So, `ls`, `ls .`, and `ls ././././.` all do the same thing, they print the contents of the current directory. This may seem like a useless shortcut right now, but we used it earlier when we copied over the data to our home directory.


To summarize, while you are in your home directory, the commands `ls ~`, `ls ~/.`, and `ls /Users/marypiper/` all do exactly the same thing. These shortcuts are not necessary, but they are really convenient!

#### Command History

You can easily access previous commands.  Hit the up arrow. Hit it again.  You can step backwards through your command history. The down arrow takes your forwards in the command history.

'Ctrl-r' will do a reverse-search through your command history.  This
is very useful.

You can also review your recent commands with the `history` command.  Just enter:

```bash
$ history
```

to see a numbered list of recent commands, including this just issues
`history` command. 

> Only a certain number of commands are stored and displayed with `history`, there is a way to modify this to store a different number.

**Other handy command-related shortcuts**

- <button>Ctrl + C</button> will cancel the command you are writing, and give you a fresh prompt.
- <button>Ctrl + A</button> will bring you to the start of the command you are writing.
- <button>Ctrl + E</button> will bring you to the end of the command.

## Examining Files

We now know how to move around the file system and look at the
contents of directories, but how do we look at the contents of files?

The easiest way to examine a file is to just print out all of the
contents using the command `cat`. Print the contents of `unix_lesson/other/sequences.fa` by entering the following command:

```bash
$ cat ~/unix_lesson/other/sequences.fa
```

This prints out the all the contents of `sequences.fa` to the screen.

> `cat` stands for catenate; it has many uses and printing the contents of a files onto the terminal is one of them.

What does this file contain?

`cat` is a terrific command, but when the file is really big, it can be annoying to use. The command, `less`, is useful for this case. Let's take a look at the raw_fastq files. These files are quite large, so we probably do not want to use the `cat` command to look at them. Instead, we can use the `less` command. 

Move back to our `raw_fastq` directory and enter the following command:

```bash
less Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
```

We will explore FASTQ files in more detail later, but notice that FASTQ files have four lines of data associated with every sequence read. Not only is there a header line and the nucleotide sequence, similar to a FASTA file, but FASTQ files also contain quality information for each nucleotide in the sequence. 

The `less` command opens the file, and lets you navigate through it. The keys used to move around the file are identical to the `man` command.

<span class="caption">Shortcuts for `less`</span>

| key              | action                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| <kbd>SPACE</kbd> | to go forward          |
| <kbd>b</kbd>     | to go backwards        |
| <kbd>g</kbd>     | to go to the beginning |
| <kbd>G</kbd>     | to go to the end       |
| <kbd>q</kbd>     | to quit                |

`less` also gives you a way of searching through files. Just hit the <kbd>/</kbd> key to begin a search. Enter the name of the string of characters you would like to search for and hit enter. It will jump to the next location where that string is found. If you hit <kbd>/</kbd> then <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, `less` will just repeat the previous search. `less` searches from the current location and works its way forward. If you are at the end of the file and search for the word "cat", `less` will not find it. You need to go to the beginning of the file and search.

For instance, let's search for the sequence `GAGACCC` in our file. You can see that we go right to that sequence and can see what it looks like. To exit hit <kbd>q</kbd>.

The `man` command (program) actually uses `less` internally and therefore uses the same keys and methods, so you can search manuals using `/` as well!

There's another way that we can look at files, and in this case, just
look at part of them. This can be particularly useful if we just want
to see the beginning or end of the file, or see how it's formatted.

The commands are `head` and `tail` and they just let you look at
the beginning and end of a file respectively.

```bash
$ head Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
```

```bash
$ tail Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
```

The `-n` option to either of these commands can be used to print the first or last `n` lines of a file. To print the first/last line of the file use:

```bash
$ head -n 1 Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq

$ tail -n 1 Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
```

## Creating, moving, copying, and removing

Now we can move around in the file structure, look at files, search files, redirect. But what if we want to do normal things like copy files or move them around or get rid of them. Sure we could do most of these things without the command line, but what fun would that be?! Besides it's often faster to do it at the command line, or you'll be on a remote server like Amazon where you won't have another option.

Our raw data in this case is fastq files. We don't want to change the original files, so let's make a copy to work with.

Lets copy the file using the copy `cp` command. Navigate to the `raw_fastq` directory and enter:

```bash
$ cp Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq Mov10_oe_1.subset-copy.fq

$ ls -l
```

Now ``Mov10_oe_1.subset-copy.fq`` has been created as a copy of `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq`

Let's make a 'backup' directory where we can put this file.

The `mkdir` command is used to make a directory. Just enter `mkdir`
followed by a space, then the directory name.

```bash
$ mkdir backup
```

> File/directory/program names with spaces in them do not work in unix, use characters like hyphens or underscores instead.

We can now move our backed up file in to this directory. We can move files around using the command `mv`. Enter this command:

```bash
$ mv *copy.fq backup
```

```bash
$ ls -l backup

-rw-rw-r-- 1 mp298 mp298 75706556 Sep 30 13:56 Mov10_oe_1.subset-copy.fq
```

The `mv` command is also how you rename files. Since this file is so
important, let's rename it:

```bash
$ cd backup

$ mv Mov10_oe_1.subset-copy.fq Mov10_oe_1.subset-backup.fq

$ ls

Mov10_oe_1.subset-backup.fq
```

Finally, we decided this was silly and want to start over.

```bash
$ cd ..

$ rm backup/Mov*
```

> The `rm` file permanently removes the file. Be careful with this command. The shell doesn't
just nicely put the files in the Trash. They're really gone.
>
> Same with moving and renaming files. It will **not** ask you if you are sure that you want to "replace existing file".
> 
> You can use `-i` modifier with both `rm` and `mv`. This will write a prompt to standard error before moving a file that would overwrite an existing file or ask before deleting the file(s).

We really don't need these backup directories, so, let's delete both. By default, `rm`, will NOT delete directories, but you use the `-r` flag if you are sure that you want to delete the directories and everything within them. To be safe, let's use it with the `-i` flag.

```bash
$ rm -ri backup_ref_data/ backup_fastq/ 
```

- `-r`: recursive, commonly used as an option when working with directories, e.g. with `cp`. 
- `-i`: prompt before every removal.
