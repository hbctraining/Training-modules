## Learning Objectives
- This lesson briefly describes commands that will be used in this workshop. We are assuming that as an someone with a basic knowledge of *bash*, you are already familiar with most of these commands.

## The basics

Let's explore the contents of the data we just downloaded.

```bash
$ ls -l ~/unix_lesson

$ cd ~/unix_lesson

$ ls -l
```

> The tilde `~` is a short way of referring to your home directory
> 
> 'cd' = 'change directory'
>
> `ls` = 'list' and it lists the contents of a directory.
>
> The `-l` argument modifies the default output of `ls` and gives a lot more information (long listing)

**Wildcards**

The '*' character is a "wildcard" and is a shortcut for "everything". Thus, if you enter `ls *.sh`, you will see all the files in a given directory ending in `.sh`. 

Now try these commands:

```bash
$ ls -l */

$ ls -l raw_fastq/M*fq
```

> An asterisk/star is only one of the many wildcards in UNIX, but this is the most powerful one.

**Tab completion**

```bash
$ ls -l raw_fastq/Mov10_oe_<tab><tab>
```

When you hit the first tab, nothing happens. The reason is that there are multiple files that start with `Mov10_oe_`. Thus, the shell does not know which one to fill in. When you hit tab again, the shell will list the possible choices.

> **Tab completion is your friend!** It helps prevent spelling mistakes, and speeds up the process of typing in the full command.

**Examining Files**

The command `cat` is to catenate and print the contents of the file to screen.

```bash
$ cat other/sequences.fa
```

The command, `less` allows you to open up the file in a new buffer and scroll through it.

```bash
less raw_fastq/Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
```

<span class="caption">Shortcuts for `less`</span>

| key              | action                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| <kbd>SPACE</kbd> | to go forward          |
| <kbd>b</kbd>     | to go backwards        |
| <kbd>g</kbd>     | to go to the beginning |
| <kbd>G</kbd>     | to go to the end       |
| <kbd>q</kbd>     | to quit                |


The commands  `head` and `tail` allow you to look at the beginning or end of the file.

```bash
$ head raw_fastq/Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq

$ tail -n 8 raw_fastq/Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
```
> The `-n` option to either of these commands can be used to specify the number `n` lines of a file. 

To count how many lines are in a file you can use the `wc` command:

```bash
wc -l raw_fastq/Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
```

**Searching within files**

The command `grep` allows us to search for a pattern within a file.

```bash
$ cd ~/unix_lesson/raw_fastq

$ grep NNNNNNNNNN Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
```

We can add *modifiers* to the command to alter the way the command works. For example, `-B` and `-A` arguments for `grep` to return the matched line plus one before (`-B1`) and two lines after (`-A2`).

```bash
$ grep -B 1 -A 2 NNNNNNNNNN Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
```

**Redirection**

To re-direct output to a file rather than the screen you can use `>`:

```bash
$ grep -B 1 -A 2 NNNNNNNNNN Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq > bad_reads.txt

$ wc -l bad_reads.txt        # How many lines in the bad_reads.txt file?
```

We can also use th pipe `|` to redirect the output of a command as input for a different command.

```bash
$ grep -B 1 -A 2 NNNNNNNNNN Mov10_oe_3.subset.fq | wc -l
```

If we use `>>`, it will append to rather than overwrite a file.  This can be useful for saving more than one search, for example.
    
```bash
$ grep -B 1 -A 2 NNNNNNNNNN Mov10_oe_3.subset.fq >> bad_reads.txt

$ wc -l bad_reads.txt        # You should see an increase in the number of lines here compared to running this command earlier
```

> The philosophy behind these **redirection** commands is that none of them really do anything all that impressive on their own. BUT, when you start chaining them together, you can do some really powerful things and very efficiently. 

## Basic commands, shortcuts, and keystrokes of note
Below is a key of the basic commands you should be familiar with in order to be able to follow this module.

```
## Commands

cd            # change directory to "~" or to specified directory
ls            # list contents of current or specified directory
man <command> # display manual for specified command
pwd           # specify present working directory
echo "..."    # display content in quotes on the standard output
history       # display previous "historical" commands
cat <file>    # display all contents of a file on the standard output
less <file>   # open a buffer with the contents of a file
head <file>   # display the first 10 lines of a file
tail <file>   # display the last 10 lines of a file
cp <..> <..>  # copy files or directories
mdkir         # make a new directory/folder
mv <..> <..>  # move or rename files or directories
rm <file>     # remove a file or a folder (-r)

## Other
~             # home directory
.             # current directory
..            # parent directory
*             # wildcard
ctrl + c      # cancel current command
ctrl + a      # start of line
ctrl + e      # end of line
```
