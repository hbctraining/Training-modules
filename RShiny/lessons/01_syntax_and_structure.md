# Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Describe RShiny
- Describe the structure of a RShiny App
- Define the syntax needed to create an RShny App

# What is Shiny?

[Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) is a package availible for both R and Python that allows the user to create a wide variety of interactive web applications (also known as apps). This workshop will focus on using Shiny within R. However, many of the principles from this workshop are applicable to Shiny on Python, but the syntax conforms to Python's syntax rules rather than R's.

Before we dig too far into the syntax or structure of an app, let's first look at one that we recently made for the Bioinformatics Core to help us carry out quality control on single-cell RNA-seq data. The link to this app can be found [here]().

As you can see, we can toggle the thresholds that we would like to use for
