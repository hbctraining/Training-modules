## Basic Shell

| Audience | Computational skills required | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | None | 2-3 hour workshop (~3 hours of trainer-led time)|


### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a **2-3 hour**, hands-on **Basic Shell** workshop led at a relaxed pace. 


### Learning Objectives

* Recognize the importance of shell in the analysis of high throughput sequencing (HTS) data
* Install and locate the software/tools necessary for accessing the shell
* Describe the organization of the file directory and how to move through it
* Demonstrate different ways to manipulate files, such as moving, copying, and renaming
* Compare different commands for examining small or large files
* Create new files and make edits to existing files with nano
* Contrast shell scripts with direct commands


> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
